		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Unique skill set where is is able to fully reset the cooldown of any ally's skill while also granting herself an extra turn.",
				reason2: "She has the ability to apply a 2 turn Defense Break and Unbuffable. While Unbuffable might not be useful in PVE, it is an extremely powerful debuff for pvp. Defense Break is universally good in every situation barred bosses that have mechanics that makes debuffing them dangerous."
			}
		]

		hero5: "Ken",
		hero5smallimg: kensmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "All-rounder bruiser that is capable of tanking, dealing damage, debuffing (Attack Down, Defense Break, Stun, Burn), and buffing himself with Speed Buff and Vigor (Grants Ken 30% Attack and Defense).",
				reason2: "One of the best and widely used bruisers in the game when it comes Guild Wars PVP."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero5: "Ravi",
		hero5smallimg: ravismall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Her built-in sustain and combat readiness makes her one of the best unit to start out with as she can easily carry most contents the game has to offer.",
				reason2: "She has high damage multipliers on her first skill, Slaugher, when using Soul Burn which makes bossing quite easy. Her third skill, Devil Drive, also allows fighting a boss with multiple enemies much more manageable as it decrease enemy combat readiness to 0 while also have a 75% chance of stunning."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero5: "Sez",
		hero5smallimg: sezsmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Very good at farming. Not as good as Vildred but he farms decently fast because of his second skill, Enroach.",
				reason2: "Despite the nerf to windrider, Sez is still quite good in a cleave team in Arena PVP and Guild Wars but he starts to fall off more and more the higher rank you are in PVP in comparison to other cleave team compositions."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero5: "Tywin",
		hero5smallimg: tywinsmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Good ice type knight that can tank the wyvern in Wyvern 11 farm and thereby jumpstarting your progression when it comes to gearing your hero units.",
				reason2: "Can work in an okay cleave team but is definitely not as reliable as the most meta cleave teams in Arena PVP. Guild Wars has more variety in team compositions so there are times where Tywin can work as a part of a cleave team (The enemy team composition is very slow, and not as tanky as the Arena defense teams)."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero5: "Vildred",
		hero5smallimg: vildredsmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Arguably the best farmer in the game. Farming stages in Epic Seven is important as you level your Phantasma in order to 6 star hero units and Vildred excels in this area. Extremely easy to gear due to Adventure's Path and Labyrinth providing gears that works well with him.",
				reason2: "The only 5 star hero that has speed as his imprint. Very strong in pvp offense when it comes to cleaving."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero4: "Angelica",
		hero4smallimg: angelicasmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Immunity Buff coverage for the entire team is very valuable when trying to clear Abyss floors and Labyrinth Raid.",
				reason2: "Have good burst heal on a rather short cooldown which allows new players more room for errors."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero4: "Armin",
		hero4smallimg: arminsmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "In my opinion one of the best tanks when it comes to clearing Abyss. Shield Wall provides team wide barriers for 3 turns while also healing based on target max hp. Flash of Light provides the needed hit chance down debuffs in abyss to prevent your team from taking too much damage.",
				reason2: "A decent PVP stall tank that has 10% damage mitigation when Shield Wall is on cooldown."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero4: "Cidd",
		hero4smallimg: ciddsmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Great PVP unit that has a high damage multiplier skill, Hack, that can attack with elemental advantage on any unit as long as he has Speed Buff on him.",
				reason2: "Very beginner friendly for new players trying to get into the PVP side of Epic Seven. However specialty changing an easy to acquire 3 star unit, Roozid, will definitely make your pvp progression more smoothly. Righteous Thief Roozid and Cidd synergizes well and is usually the most common combo new players use in PVP."
			}

		hero4: "Clarissa",
		hero4smallimg: clarissasmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Decent farmer although not as good as Vildred.",
				reason2: "With a couple molagora investment, she can be a decent secondary DPS as well as a defense breaker."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero4: "Corvus",
		hero4smallimg: corvussmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Strong Guild War unit that is capable of winning in a 1 v 3 scenario versus certain team compositions. When placed in a defense team composition, opposing opponents are forced to build a team capable of killing him or there is a chance that Corvus can time them out.",
				reason2: "Having no cooldown on Fury's Advent can make him nearly unkillable provided that he has enough Fighting Spirit to keep using it. Other than incredible sustain, Corvus skill kit is overloaded with Stun debuffs as well as the ability to transfer debuffs to an enemy."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero4: "Karin",
		hero4smallimg: karinsmall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Decent single target damage dealer for Wyvern 11 farming when enough gear is invested. If there is no gear invested on her, Karin is still quite good as she provides a rather consistent Defense Break debuff.",
				reason2: "She requires zero molagora investment to function when it comes to Wyvern 11 farming."
			}
		]
	},
	{
		hero4: "Schuri",
		hero4smallimg: schurismall,
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Decent Combat Readiness pusher as long as he can crit the enemies. In harder contents like Abyss, Schuri can cycle more turns for the entire team.",
				reason2: "He has a rather high speed imprint going upwards of 14 speed to the two back slots of the team composition. This is quite useful when it comes to giving the main Combat Readiness pusher the speed needed to go first at the start of PVP."
