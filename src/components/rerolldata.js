		hero5good: "Iseria",
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Extremely unique skill set where is is able to fully reset the cooldown of any ally's skill while also granting herself an extra turn.",
				reason2: "She has the ability to apply a 2 turn Defense Break and Unbuffable. While Unbuffable might not be useful in PVE, it is an extremely powerful debuff for pvp. Defense Break is universally good in every situation barred bosses that have mechanics that makes debuffing them dangerous."

		hero5good: "Vildred",
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Arguably the best farmer in the game. Farming stages is important as it helps level your Phantasma in order to 6 star hero units and Vildred excels in this area. Extremely easy to gear due to Adventure's Path and Labyrinth providing gears that works well with him.",
				reason2: "The only 5 star hero that has speed as his imprint. Very strong in pvp offense when it comes to cleaving."

		hero5ok: "Ravi",
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Her built-in sustain and combat readiness makes her one of the best unit to start out with as she can easily carry most contents the game has to offer.",
				reason2: "She has high damage multipliers on her first skill, Slaugher, which makes bossing quite easy. Her third skill, Devil Drive, also allows fighting a boss with multiple enemies much more manageable as it decrease enemy combat readiness to 0 while also have a 75% chance of stunning."

		hero4: "Angelica",
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "Immunity coverage for the entire team is very valuable when trying to clear Abyss floors and Labyrinth Raid. ",
				reason2: "Have good burst heal on a rather short cooldown which allows new players more room for errors."
			}

	{
		hero4: "Armin",
		hero_details: [
			{
				reason1: "In my opinion one of the best tanks when it comes to clearing Abyss. Shield Wall provides team wide barriers for 3 turns while also healing based on target max hp. Flash of Light provides the needed hit chance down debuffs in abyss to prevent your team from taking too much damage.",
				reason2: "A decent PVP stall tank that has 10% damage mitigation when Shield Wall is on cooldown."
