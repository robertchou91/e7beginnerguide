	overview: "Sanctuary is an important aspect of your progression. The workshops allow you to generate all sorts of important resources (Penguins, Phantasma, Molagora, Skystones, Ancient Coins, and Conquest Points) and craft Equipments and Catalysts necessary for you to speed up progression. Which is why it is important to quickly obtain all the Breath of Orbis that are scattered all over the Adventure maps. There will be one Breath of Orbis in each map with an icon hovering over the stage to indicate that a Breath of Orbis can be obtain.",
	overview2: "Because it is impossible to fully upgrade every single workshop, players have to prioritize on what they want to upgrade unless they are willing to spend a large sum of gold resetting upgrades (not really ideal for a new player to spend that much gold).",
	priority: "When you start playing, it is your best interest to collect all the Breath of Orbis as soon as possible since the workshops in the Sanctuary are valuable throughout your progression. This section of the guide is mainly to recommend priority on what to upgrade initially with your Breath of Orbis.",
	forestofsoul: "Upgrading Forest of Souls, Soul Isle Extension, to Level 3 should be the first thing you should spend with your Breath of Orbis. Increasing the slot to nuture creatures from 1 slot to 3 slots will speed up the time it takes for you to make Phantasma which means you will 6 star your units at a faster rate.",
	highcommand: "The next thing you should upgrade should be the High Command. I suggest only upgrading each of the building to Level 1 in High Command. This will allow you to dispatch two missions for 10 Conquest points and 10 Ancient coins for a total of 2 Energy every 2 hours.",
	lowpriority: "Although this section is about low priority upgrades, it does not mean that it is unnecessary. I place these upgrades on a lower priority because as a new player, these are not as important. However as you progress further, these upgrades become more and more important."
